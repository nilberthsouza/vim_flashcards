Vim Flashcards
==============

Vim Flashcards is a collection of Vim tips and commands compiled
for the purpose of developing a deep familiarity of available Vim
commands. The format provided is suitable for import into Anki, a
free spaced repetitition learning program, but may be suitable for
import into other programs.


Using with Anki
---------------

You can use the last uploaded version of this card stack by installing
Anki and search for "Vim Commands" in the list of flashcard sets.
Alternately, you can import the file directly into Anki, to use the
latest set of flashcards found here.

If you have an older version of the card stack you downloaded through
Anki, you can import new cards from this deck by selecting
File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Import. By default, only new cards will be
imported by Anki.


Using with other flashcard programs
-----------------------------------

I am interested in making the flashcards available to other flashcard
programs. If you're interested in importing the flashcards into a
program that doesn't support this file format, please contact me
and let me know.


Feedback
--------

I'm eager to hear feedback about the vim_flashcards project! Stories
of success and failure, suggestions for commands or command sets
to include, error reports, etc. Just submit a Github issue on the
